        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>
          This platform was developed with a simple goal in mind — to support
          FINKI students in navigating the often overwhelming process of finding
          internships. With technology advancing rapidly, hands-on experience is
          crucial, and we aim to bridge the gap between education and
          opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website automatically scrapes two main sources:
          <strong>1)</strong>
          <em>Internship listings posted on the official FINKI website</em> from
          partnered companies, and <strong>2)</strong>
          <em>Junior-level and internship positions from LinkedIn</em>. The
          results are displayed in a clear, user-friendly way to help students
          make informed choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site updates automatically to provide fresh listings and reduce
          the need for manual job searching. Every opportunity shown is meant to
          be relevant, accessible, and student-focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built as a side project by a fellow FINKI student, this tool is
          open-source, lightweight, and designed to grow with your feedback.
          Thank you for using it — and good luck on your career journey!
